This repository implements sentiment analysis models using various machine learning techniques to classify text data (e.g., tweets) as positive, negative, or neutral. Explore models like:

- **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) can potentially offer improved accuracy and robustness.
- **Naive Bayes:** This statistical classifier makes efficient use of features for text classification, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data.
- **Deep Learning (LSTM):** Long Short-Term Memory networks excel at processing sequential data like text, capturing long-term dependencies within sequences. (**Optional, uncomment if applicable**).

## Key Features

- **Thorough Text Preprocessing:** Rigorous techniques (punctuation removal, lowercasing, stopword removal) ensure clean, high-quality data for the models.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Classification reports and confusion matrices provide insights into model performance.

## Installation
