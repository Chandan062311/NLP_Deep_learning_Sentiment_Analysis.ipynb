# Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning Techniques

This repository implements sentiment analysis models using various machine learning techniques to classify text data (e.g., tweets) as positive, negative, or neutral. Explore models like:

- **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) can potentially offer improved accuracy and robustness.
- **Naive Bayes:** This statistical classifier makes efficient use of features for text classification, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data.
- **Deep Learning (LSTM):** Long Short-Term Memory networks excel at processing sequential data like text, capturing long-term dependencies within sequences. (**Optional, uncomment if applicable**).

## Key Features

- **Thorough Text Preprocessing:** Rigorous techniques (punctuation removal, lowercasing, stopword removal) ensure clean, high-quality data for the models.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Classification reports and confusion matrices provide insights into model performance.
